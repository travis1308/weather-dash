# Weather Dashboard

## What this Site Does
This site is used to display weather utilizing the OpenWeather API publicly available. When you type in the city, it pulls the location coordinates and feeds it through several functions to display the weather for that particular city. The weather is then displayed for current and future conditions in a future 5 day forecast. As you enter a city for displaying weather it is fed into a search history that is locally stored utilizing Web API local storage features. If you click on a previously searched city it will repopulate the current weather for that particular city.
